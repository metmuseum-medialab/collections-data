In addition to forms of Osiris, Re-Harakhty and Atum—as the rising and setting sun and thus connected with continued life—are particularly favored focal gods.  In contrast to stelae of the Third Intermediate Period,subdued coloring and a more standardized style are adopted in this period.Here the lady of the house Tabimut, daughter of the doorkeeper of the house of Amun Ia and the lady of the house Harhabhes,adores Re-Harakhti followed by Isis and the Four Sons of Horus. The text mentions Re-Harakhti and Atum.",
