 "Description": "Obverse and reverse, Dionysos with men and youthsThough the name the Affecter may have a pejorative ring, attention to his work reveals his accomplishment as an artist. The representation of Dionysos, the god of wine, exemplifies the Affecter's solid, slow-moving figures, sometimes ungainly but always articulated with the most precise and varied detail.",
