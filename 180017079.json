 "Description": "Unusual violin form fitted with soundpost and bar, but having many folds of slightly conical brass tubing concealed within the body. The upper end of the tube passes through the neck and issues at the back of the scroll, wgere a mouthpiece is inserted. The other end of the tube widens within the body into a flattened rectangular bell, which takes the place of the usual block at the bottom of the violin. Four pegs, tipped with ivory, and four strings which pass over the bridge and are attached.  This example is a reproduction based on an earlier version in the Museum Carolino, Augusteum, Salzburg.",
