 "Description": "The evil king Zahhak faints when his wise men reveal the meaning of his nightmare: that one Faridun, as yet unborn, will justly bring about his downfall and death. The logical disposition of figures in space reflects the influence of the late Timurid Herat School of painting, whereas the bending rosebush and snail-like clouds at the right derive from Turkmen painting as practiced at Tabriz. The animated characterizations, however, are typical of the work of Sultan Muhammad, head of the royal workshop.",
