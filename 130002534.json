 "Description": "Representations of flute players are found in both sanctuaries and tombs in Cyprus. They would play music eternally for the divinity or the deceased. The strap around the head of the player, a phorbeia, held the flute in place and prevented the cheeks from swelling, thus helping to control the breath. Egyptian influence is evident in the smooth wig. The piece may have formed a pair with 74.51.2509.",
