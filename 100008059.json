 "Description": "This openwork spacer, an element to keep multiple strands of a bracelet or necklace from becoming tangled, depicts an emblematic form of Hathor's head from the sistrum. To either side are uraeus cobras, the one on the right wearing the white crown of Upper Egypt and that on the left the red crown of Lower Egypt. Last are marsh groups - lotus buds and blossoms, the later serving as seats for cats.",
