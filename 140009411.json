 "Description": "Ottoman taste for Persian poetry led to the production of manuscripts such as this copy of the tale of Khusrau and Shirin by the poet Hatifi. The calligraphy, illumination, gilding, and painting of this manuscript were completed by a single artist calling himself Suzi (\"the burning one\"). His distinctive painting style exhibits elements borrowed from Aq Quyunlu painting of western Iran and European sources—such as the incorporation of  architectural perspective seen here.",
