 "Description": "This book documents the artist’s experience of living with Aiden, a male prostitute he met while working in London as a set designer. It consists of Beard’s text, his intimate—sometimes explicit—photographs of Aiden, and Aiden’s own words, interwoven Rashomon-like to reveal the coinciding ties and disconnects between sex and desire.",
 "Provenance": [
  "From the artist, through Wessel O'Connor gallery."
