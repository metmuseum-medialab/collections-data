 "Description": "Upper frieze, Herakles and centaursLower frieze, flutist leading procession of womenThe upper frieze, depicting Herakles in the company of three centaurs, is perhaps a reference to the story of the Greek hero's battle with Pholos and his fellow centaurs. The scene below has no obvious narrative connection to that one. This shape, frequently made of alabaster and copied by Corinthian potters, is rare with Etruscan potters working in Southern Etruria.",
