 "Description": "Vertical panel with pendant design at center with the text on a cartouche set in an ornament with a flower-arabesque pattern. The ornament is topped by a vase-shaped motif with flowers growing above, and is flanked by axe-shaped motifs. From a set of ten plates with pendant designs, five of which show deities in niches. The four other designs are decorated with ornate flower-arabesques and are most likely designs for pendant versos. This plate belongs to the first edition of the series, published by Hans I Liefrinck in Antwerp before 1573. Jan Collaert I produced several series of plates with pendant designs, a practice continued by his son, Adriaen Collaert.",
