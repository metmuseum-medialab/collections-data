 "Description": "While this parasol is of French make, the accession records suggest that it was purchased in South America by a United States serviceman (the donor's father).  The intricate carving on the handle is very detailed, depicting a variety of motifs including male and female figures and architectural structures that are vertically aligned with a sense of perspective as is a hallmark of Asian artistry.  The records also describe the end of the handle as a \"dragon's head with a movable tongue.\"",
