 "Description": "Trade cards from the \"Fancy Dress Ball Costumes\" series (N107), issued in a set of 50 cards in 1889 to promote Honest Long Cut Tobacco, manufactured by W. Duke Sons & Co. Each card depicts a famous actress of the day wearing an elaborate hat. Series N107 uses the same checklist of images as the smaller-format series, N73. In N107, however, each image is surrounded by a colored border, expanding the size of the overall card.",
