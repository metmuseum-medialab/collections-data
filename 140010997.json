 "Description": "A window such as this with brightly colored panes in blue, orange, green, and red might have been found in a room of a late Ottoman aristocratic home, like the Damascus reception room also in the Museum's collection (1970.70) Tinted glass was favored because it filtered the light, but it also complemented the multihued furnishings of these rooms.",
