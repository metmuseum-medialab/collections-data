 "Description": "The silk soutache ornament, ribbon and tassels featured on this hat lend a military feel, which could have been a way for the wearer to show support for the American soldiers during World War II. Women frequently wore elaborate millinery creations during the war years to off-set their subdued clothing, influenced by rationing, and to show support for American industry.",
