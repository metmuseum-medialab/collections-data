 "Description": "In this manuscript, Xie constructed a chronology of the artist Shitao (1642–1707), including notes on his dated works. He also transcribed excerpts from three texts dating from markedly different time periods: Xiaotian jizhuan (1861), a history of the Southern Ming dynasty (1644–61) by Xu Nai (1810–1862); Qiufeng wenji, the collected writings of Li Lin (1634–1710); and Guixin zazhi, miscellany by Zhou Mi (1232–1298).",
