 "Description": "The happi is a costume unique to the Noh stage that is often worn as an outer jacket for a warrior's role. When it is slipped off the right arm or when both sleeves are hiked up, it is used to give the impression of armor. Many lined happi, like this one, have bold designs of Chinese inspiration. Another kind of happi, probably more familiar, is a short coat worn by townsmen during the Edo period and later.",
