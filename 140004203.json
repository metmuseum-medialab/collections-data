 "Description": "This star‑shaped tile with interlaced design once graced the walls of the west iwan (vault) of the Madrasa al‑Ghiyathiyya, a religious school completed in 846/1442–43 in the city of Khargird in northeastern Iran. This example was executed in the so‑called cuerda seca (dry cord) technique wherein a greasy material separates the various colored glazes. During the firing process, the greasy line melts, leaving behind an unglazed band between the glazed areas.",
