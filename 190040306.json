 "Description": "An intimate-rather than official-portrait, this photograph is by an aristocratic amateur photographer who had access to the imperial court. Like his cousin Édouard, seen at the far left in Olympe Aguado's Presentation of the Prince Imperial (2005.100.175), Benjamin Delessert probably learned photography in the studio of Gustave LeGray.",
