 "Description": "Picasso spent part of the summer of 1912 with his companion, Eva Gouel, at Sorgues, a small town near Avignon in the south of France. A number of the drawings he made there show seated men wearing hats, in the manner of Cézanne's famous \"Card Players\" (1890-92), painted in nearby Aix-en-Provence. In the Metropolitan's drawing, the subject holds a newspaper, although it is difficult to distinguish his body from the paper. By this time, Picasso composed figures and objects with rectangular planes, suggesting shallow reliefs, rather than small brushstrokes.",
