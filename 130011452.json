 "Description": "The style of this gorgoneion antefix is of a transitional type between the archaic, more fierce Medusa and the calm Medusa of later centuries. Traces of white slip remain on her face, and a few traces of paint from the once bright yellow hair can still be seen on her head. The irises of her eyes would have been painted blue or black.",
