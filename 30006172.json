 "Description": "This votive plaque with a raised border around its edges has a Sabaean dedicatory inscription.While the worship of aniconic images was widespread among South Arabian cultures, the precise significance of the inscription as a cult object is uncertain. The practice of dedicating the inscription itself, as opposed to placing the inscription on an object intended for dedication, is a departure from the contemporary customs of greater Mesopotamia and Iran.",
