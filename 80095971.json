 "Description": "Gloves predominance changed from the seventeenth century to the twentieth, from being extremely popular, to almost unnecessary.  By the end of the nineteenth century and into the first part of the twentieth, gloves were worn for particular day and evening activities.  Tight fitting gloves, in varying lengths and colors were in vogue and worn by both men and women. Fine suede gloves, commonly referred to as doeskin were produced in nuanced shades from bone white to brown.  This pair is one of the museum's holdings of fine unworn French gloves representing the range of colors and various lengths fashionable in the early twentieth century.",
