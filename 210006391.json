 "Description": "These two small works incorporate cut and torn papers in abstract arrangements. References to musical notation, literature, and mathematics are reflected in the choice of papers and in the hand-written inscriptions, which the artist combined with a rhythmic, almost poetic quality echoing the work of Kurt Schwitters. The small size of these collages is typical of Horton’s work: the artist’s penchant for creating intimately-scaled artworks was derived in part from their origins in his personal diaries. Horton, who worked both as an artist and a lawyer, also experimented with photography and created delicate, layered abstract paintings on paper until his early death at age 35.",
