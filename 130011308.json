 "Description": "Pentheus attacked by a womanThis piece consists of two joined fragments, 19.192.81.2 and .8. Pentheus is shown holding two spears and a sword. He brandishes the latter in defense against a woman who attacks him from the right with a thyrsos (fennel stalk with ivy). The death of Pentheus is the main subject of the front of the vase. His expression is masterfully conveyed by the relief lines.",
