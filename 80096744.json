 "Description": "The \"Peacock Revolution\" of the late 1960s had opened the door to increased variety and self-expression in menswear, and even as more conservative styles began to predominate by the late 1970s, a wider range of choices was available to those wanting it.  Worn by a television fashion director, presumably a man with an elevated dedication to the latest styles, this pair of shoes combines two trendy elements of the period: the jazz-shoe style and the jelly sole.   As an inexpensive, distinctively colored, all synthetic item of limited timeliness, the shoes can be understood as a response to the accelerating consumer culture and material disposability of 1980s.",
