 "Description": "Obverse,  warrior and quadriga (four-horse chariot) with driverReverse, Dionysos and two maenadsThe scene on the obverse shows a four-horse chariot from which a warrior has dismounted in order to fight. The painter seems to have a predilection for effects of glaze on a reserved background—note the armor of the charioteer and, on the reverse, the black kantharos (drinking cup with high handles) of Dionysos.",
