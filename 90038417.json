 "Description": "This unusually tentative still life represents an early attempt to incorporate Cubist principles into his graphic work.  The drypoint's faceted surface comprised of short hatched lines infuses the image with a vibrating light that is distinct from the pure outlines of his Saltimbanques prints.  This impression was bequeathed to the Museum by one of America's earliest champions of European modernism, the photographer Alfred Stieglitz.",
