 "Description": "This is one of a series of twelve jeweled sabers made in Hungarian style for use at the Saxon court in Dresden. These twelve swords are recorded as having had new wrist chains added in 1687 and as having been used again in 1709. This example bears what may be the mark of Georg Hoffmann (recorded 1586–1609), a goldsmith working in Breslau (now Wrocław, Poland).",
