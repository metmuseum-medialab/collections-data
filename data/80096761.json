 "Description": "Beth Levine's ingenious and witty designs, experimentation with novel materials, and ability to invent practical solutions have earned her the place of top female shoe designer of the 20th century. Levine was particularly adept at predicting future trends and devising structural innovations. Chief among her achievements were the popularization of the fashion boot in the 1960s, the use of vinyl and spandex, and the inventions of the Spring-o-lator mule, the stocking shoe, and the topless shoe. These boundary-breaking innovations earned Levine a Coty award 1967.This design presents and intriguing nexus of old and new.  Short ankle boots had been worn as a slipper or après-ski style through the 1950s, but here Levine updates the form as a progressive dressy style, suitable for wear with evening trousers.  While Levine is not known for historical references in her work, this design closely resembles early 19th century side-laced ankle boots.",
