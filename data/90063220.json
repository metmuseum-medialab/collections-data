 "Description": "Embroidery pattern made up out of so-called knot work. The main pattern has a circular shape and is presented in white on a dark ground. The knotted ropes or straps form three tiers surrounding the central motif which is an oblong panel, left blank. On all four corners another, leaf-shaped ornament has been added which sticks out of the circle.  The leaves are filled with more knot work in white on the dark ground while swirling straps in black surround them.",
