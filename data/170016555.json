 "Description": "Painted in grisaille (shades of grey) in a style associated with the mid-1200s in France, these fragments are among numerous remnants of the elaborate glass windows that once decorated Castle Montfort/Starkenberg. One shows the nose and eye of a human face; the others display portions of vines with fleur-de-lis terminals.",
