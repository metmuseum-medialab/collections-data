 "Description": "Antiquity provided the inspiration for this dressing table and hand mirror by Armand-Albert Rateau, who borrowed both its form and decoration from Pompeiian models (though the bird motif may also derive from Persian miniatures). Rateau conceived the model for a sumptuous bathroom (now destroyed) that he designed in 1921 for the Duchess of Alba at the Palacio Liria in Madrid. He later included a version as part of his décor for the Pavilion de l’Élégance at the 1925 Paris exposition, which housed displays of the couturiers Jeanne Lanvin, Jenny, Callot Soeurs, and Worth and the jeweler Cartier. The Metropolitan purchased the table directly fromRateau; in gratitude, the designer offered the hand mirror to the Museum as a gift.",
