 "Description": "Design for a horizontal panel with a male figure in the middle, seen from the back, whose lower body consists of rinceaux which meander across the page. He looks left, into the eyes of a fantastical creature with a grotesque head springing forth from one of the rinceaux. Surrounding him are three more male hybrid creatures whose lower bodies similarly consist out of acanthus rinceaux or leaves.",
