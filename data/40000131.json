 "Description": "These small gauntlets belong to an armor for foot-tournament made for the seven-year-old heir to the Spanish throne, the future Philip III (1578–1621, ruled from 1598). The decoration is typically Milanese, with bands of chiseled and gold-damascened trophy and grotesque ornament outlined with silver dots. A figure of Mars, god of war, is seen at the top of each cuff.",
