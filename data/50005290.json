 "Description": "This ornament is probably from the middle Cauca River valley, where the classic Quimbaya culture flourished prior to the tenth century. This culture is renowned for expertly cast, hollow gold objects made from wax models. These objects, often containers in the form of human figures, display a high degree of realism, elegance, and technical perfection (see the lime container in this gallery). After the classic period the use of sheet gold increased and ornaments became simpler.",
