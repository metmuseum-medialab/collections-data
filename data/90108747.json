The Exercise of Arms was first published as a complete volume in 1608, and several more editions followed shortly after, with Dutch, French, German, English, and Danish versions produced. This version (49.95.1110-1227) belongs to the German translation of the third edition (titled \"Waffenhandlung von den Rören Musquetten undt Spiessen\"), which was published in The Hague in 1608.",
