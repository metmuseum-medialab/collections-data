 "Description": "Obverse, woman and egg-laying goose, between geeseReverse, ridersThe vignette of a woman among geese was surely observed by the painter firsthand. It is impossible for us to know, however, whether the scene alludes to a story—such as a goose that lays golden eggs—or simply presents a woman at home in contrast to the men riding out on horseback depicted on the other side.",
