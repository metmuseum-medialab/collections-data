 "Description": "Imperial Privilege: Vienna Porcelain of Du Paquier, 1718-44:This vessel was probably intended to be used in the intimate living quarters of a house, which, in the eighteenth century would have been far removed from the kitchen. The porcelain insert once held a metal liner where the food was placed. The heat source may have been a small candle set inside the perforated base. The decoration includes beautifully painted naturalistic flowers, trelliswork, and four figures holding either tankards or crescent-shaped pastries.",
