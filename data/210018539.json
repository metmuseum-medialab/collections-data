 "Description": "Czeschka officially joined the Wiener Werkstätte in 1905 and resigned three years later to take a teaching post at the Hamburg Kunstgewerbeschule. He did, however, continue to submit designs and exhibit with the Wiener Werkstätte until 1915, becoming a leading disseminator of the style. The pattern on this flatware is a fine example of the exuberance of Czeschka’s well-documented floral designs for jewelry, metalwork, graphics, textiles, and theater sets and costumes.",
