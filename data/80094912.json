 "Description": "In contrast to the oversized wide-brimmed hats which had dominated the 1908-1911 period, the toque, with its emphasis on height rather than width, became an increasingly fashionable form in the 1910s. This handsome toque features fluted sides which add interest to the shape and relieve the severity of the allover fur.  The stylized crane appliqué on the front corresponds to an increasing interest in Japanese design in the period.",
