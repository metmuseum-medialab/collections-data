 "Description": "Published as part of Antonio Lafreri's Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae (The Mirror of Roman Magnificence).  This print comes from a scrapbook of 3 volumes with inlaid engraved and etched plates.  It is likely that individuals who purchased the prints from Lafreri made their own selections and had them bound. For a history of the publication of the Speculum prints, see Peter Parshall, \"Antonio Lafreri's Speculum Romanae Magnificentiae,\" Print Quarterly, 2001 (1-28).",
