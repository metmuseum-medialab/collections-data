 "Description": "When Sugimoto first arrived in New York in 1974, he was fascinated by the dioramas at the American Museum of Natural History. \"I made a curious discovery,\" he later recalled. \"The stuffed animals positioned before painted backdrops looked utterly fake, yet by taking a quick peek with one eye closed, all perspective vanished, and suddenly they looked very real. I'd found a way to see the world as a camera does. However fake the subject, once photographed, it's as good as real.\" Using careful framing, long exposure times, and a large view camera for clarity of detail, Sugimoto heightens the illusionism of the dioramas themselves, creating exquisite effigies of a natural world on the verge disappearing.",
