 "Description": "Nushirvan (r. 531–79) became known for the reforms he instituted, especially in the system of taxation. Here he dictates to a scribe a letter to his agents, outlining the new system and also setting forth principles of conduct: judiciousness and absolute scrupulousness in the administration of their duties. Muzaffar 'Ali, who painted this illustration, worked for the Safavid court through the entire reign of Shah Tahmasp. As is typical of works by the second generation of Shahnama artists, the figures here are larger in scale and fewer in number than in comparable Shahnama compositions completed between 1525 and 1530.",
