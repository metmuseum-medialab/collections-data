 "Description": "Amelia Beard Hollenback (1877-1969) was the daughter of the prominent financier and philanthropist John Welles Hollenback (1835-1927). The members of the Hollenback family were avid travelers, making frequently trips throughout Europe and the United States. This chic coat, charmingly fashioned from a man's frock coat style, was made for Amelia in winter 1882 during a trip in Paris. The incised buttons and bound buttonholes are a particularly Parisian touch.",
