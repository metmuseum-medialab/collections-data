 "Description": "This print is from L'Idea di un Principe ed Eroe Cristiano in Francesco I d'Este, di Modena e Reggio Duca VIII [...] collected in an album of brown boards. Four prints are hinged on each page of the album with a seventeenth- or eighteenth-century inscription pasted beneath the print on the album page.  The prints are etched in the manner of Callot and illustrate Francesco I d'Este's virtuous nature as a ruler in battle, in religious matters, and in daily life. Three of the prints are signed by Jean Sauvé, who presumably worked with Fenice on the execution of the illustrations for this book. There are sixty-seven copper plates and forty-five preparatory drawings in the Museo Civico di Modena.",
