 "Description": "The lines of this evening dress represent the transitional shape found during the teens to the early 1920s. Executed in an appealing shade of blue, its shorter length and tubular shape presage the silhouette to come. While many examples of 1920s dresses are extant, dresses from this era are more difficult to find.",
