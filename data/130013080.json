 "Description": "Great numbers of these jars have been found at Sardis as well as around the Mediterranean. Because they seem to have been a specialty of Lydia, modern scholars call this type of vase a lydion. Such jars probably contained baccaris, a perfume for which Sardis was noted in antiquity.",
