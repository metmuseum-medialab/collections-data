 "Description": "This head was once part of a mummiform figure of Hatshepsut that decorated a niche on the west wall of the upper terrace of her temple at Deir el-Bahri. The heads of three of these niche statues are in the Museum's collection. This one wears the tall white crown of Upper Egypt and probably was originally in one of the niches on the south side of the entrance to the sanctuary.  The other two heads (31.3.157, 31.3.164) wear the combined \"double crown\" of Upper and Lower Egypt and probably were in niches north of the sanctuary entrance.",
