 "Description": "The bottle dates from the earliest production of porcelain at Meissen, and is known as Böttger porcelain after its inventor, Johann Friedrich Böttger (1682–1719). Here, a Japanese sake bottle has been transformed by the incorporation of Baroque motifs and a more prominent, stepped foot. It was probably modeled by the Saxon court goldsmith, Johann Jacob Irminger (1635–1724).",
