 "Description": "Two friezes of animalsThe broad-bottomed oinochoe, represented by this example, is a characteristic and very long-lived shape in Corinth. The presence of a lid distinguishes it from oinochoai of other Greek regions as well. Although the conventional name is retained, the shape was not necessary used to pour wine.",
