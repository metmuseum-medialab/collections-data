 "Description": "The American Legion was founded in 1919 for veterans who served in the First World War. After the war, the Legion served to help integrate young men and women into civilian life following their tours abroad. This uniform, a woman's American Legion suit, marks the first war in which women actively participated in large numbers. It is likely that this uniform and that of a Yeomen (F) in the navy (2009.300.219a–d) were worn by the donor, Mrs. A. E. Laurencelle (née Ethel Redmond).",
