 "Description": "Roman adaptation of a Greek work of the 4th century B.C., known as the Apollo LykeiosA celebrated bronze statue of Apollo, standing at rest with his hand on his head, stood throughout antiquity in the Lykeion, a large open area just outside the walls of Athens that was devoted to athletics and philosophical discussion. The graceful pose was later adopted for other statues of Apollo, such as this small-scale work with almost feminine features and hair style.",
