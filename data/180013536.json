 "Description": "When shut, this sewing and dressing case gives no hint of enclosing a miniature 4-octave piano. It was imported and sold in Philadelphia by Sarah Hart & Son, dealers in portable furniture, stationery, and perfume. The rosewood case, standing on a carved acanthus pedestal over a footed base, bears on its lid an inlaid eagle over a musical trophy, surrounded by a wreath of oak and laurel. A hinged looking-glass can prop up the lid.  Small compartments and spools of thread occupy a removable tray over the strings. The Viennese action has tiny hammers that each strike a single string except in the top octave, which is double-strung. There are no dampers.",
