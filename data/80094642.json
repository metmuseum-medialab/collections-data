 "Description": "Brooke Cadwallader was a well-known printed textile designer of the mid-20th century.  His whimsical prints drew on the interests of a country in and out of war and were used on scarves, ties, aprons and various other accessories.  He was often inspired by research completed at the Brooklyn Museum to which several ties in the collection, such as this one, can attest.  This textile, which Cadwallader named \"Titian,\" draws inspiration from tapestries and 19th century arts and crafts prints, such as those by William Morris (1834-1896).    Title of textile design is \"Titian\"addorsed and confronted animals including peacocks, donkeys and bears",
