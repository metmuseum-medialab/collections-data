 "Description": "This photograph is part of a series of projects in which Lee has immersed herself in a series of American subcultures-punks, tourists, yuppies, lesbians, club kids, drag queens, senior citizens-observing and adopting the dress, behavior, and body language of each for weeks or months at a time. After transforming her own appearance, Lee approaches members of the group, explains her project, and has a friend or passerby photograph her with a small automatic-focus camera. Part Zelig, part Cindy Sherman, Lee cleverly explores the mutability of social identity as well as the immigrant's desire to blend into a new culture. This photograph was taken in a trailer park in eastern Ohio.",
