 "Description": "Christian Dior's final collections in 1957 showed glimpses of a new direction, an abandonment of the \"New Look\" silhouette in favor of a softer, less defined waist. The title of his spring-summer line in 1957, \"Libre\" or \"Free,\" provided some indication of the designer's intent and pieces like this one show how he represented the idea. The pink color, the use of organza, the wrapped neckline and princess seams uniting the bodice, waist and hip all convey a feeling of softness. The bodice, however, is still completely boned, showing that Dior's notion of freedom had limitations.",
