 "Description": "The ease with which Attic potters and painters moved between shapes and between figural and foliate iconography is evident in this work. Above the head is a cuff embellished with a palmette ornament typical of cups and pots at the turn of the fifth century B.C. In the present context, the effect is that of a floral diadem or polos (headdress).",
