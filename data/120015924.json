 "Description": "Imperial Privilege: Vienna Porcelain of Du Paquier, 1718-44:Although mostly used to ornament borders, Laub- und Bandelwerk designs could also be the principal decorative motif, as on this small tureen and stand, where the effect is almost that of cagework over the porcelain. Both gilding and silvering—another characteristic feature of Du Paquier porcelain—were employed to further enrich the object, and the cover is crowned with the figure of a Turk seated on a cushion and rug, a favorite motif of the manufactory.",
