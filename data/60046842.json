 "Description": "These intricate ruled-line drawings of ancient architecture were probably traced from paintings. The photograph mounted below the drawing, made prior to restoration, illustrates the challenges of conserving the thin, brittle paper Xie favored for making tracing copies, particularly those sheets that were folded, creased, and, at times, torn.",
