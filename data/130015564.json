 "Description": "While the shapes of most vases correspond to an established typology, this unusual piece was probably produced for a specific purpose. The strainer at the top permitted the solid portion of a mixture to be separated from the liquid portion, which could then be poured through the spout. The bail handle at the top allowed the vase to be suspended; the two handles at the sides facilitated lifting and pouring.",
