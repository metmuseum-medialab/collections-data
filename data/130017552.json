 "Description": "Part of the flat bottom of a dish with a low base ring on the exterior. The opaque red color was very popular and appears on numerous examples of Roman cast monochrome glass. The surface often appears as a weathered green color because the copper, added to the glass to give it is vivid red color, has leeched out over time.",
