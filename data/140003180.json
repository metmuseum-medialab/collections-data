 "Description": "This bowl exhibits a rare glaze type referred to as lajvardina, from the Persian word lajvard, or lapis lazuli (a deep blue colored stone containing gold inclusions). Its design comprises small squares of gold leaf, carefully arranged into intricate patterns with delicate red and white overpainting. Production of this type of glazed ware is limited to the Ilkhanid period in Iran. And the luxurious nature of this example suggests it was destined for wealthy patrons.",
