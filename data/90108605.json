 "Description": "Trade cards from the \"Baseball Caramels\" series (E91), issued 1908-1910 by the American Caramel Company. The series is divided into three distinct subsets, known to collectors as E91-A, E91-B, and E91-C. With 99 cards total in E91, and 33 cards included in each subset, this particular set of baseball cards is less popular with collectors because the same 33 generic illustrations are used to depict two to three players each. Subset E91-A was released in 1908 and includes baseball players from the Philadelphia Athletics (AL), New York Giants (NL), and the Chicago Cubs (NL). Subset E91-B was released in 1909 and includes players from the Philadelphia Athletics (AL), the New York Giants (NL), and the Chicago Cubs (NL). Subset E91-C was released in 1910 and includes players from the Pittsburgh Pirates (NL), Washington Senators (NL), and the Boston Red Sox (NL). This card could be from either subset E91-A or E91-B as the player is included in both sets and the card verso that includes the player checklist is affixed to the original album page.",
