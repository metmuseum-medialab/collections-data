 "Description": "Five designs for drinking vessels, four portrayed in roughly the same size and the fifth, on the right side, on a larger scale. Two designs in the upper left corner are characterized by a high stem and relatively fine ears. The two designs below show drinking cups or chalices with a Latin cross on the cup. The larger design on the right shows a drinking cup with two ears and a lid shaped like a crown. The designs are individually numbered (continuous from the previous pages).",
