 "Description": "This bowl and 64.178.2 are the earliest dated pieces attributed to Abu Zaid al‑Kashani, a famous potter and painter specializing in both luster and mina'i. Inscribed in both Arabic and Persian, both bowls bear dates on the exterior, good wishes to their owners in the kufic band around the rim, and verses of poetry—composed by Abu Zaid himself—below the fish pond. The figural scenes do not directly illustrate the verses, but may relate thematically.",
