 "Description": "A mandarin orange tree (tachibana) bearing fruit and flowers rises from the center back hem of this robe in a design scheme typical of the second half of the eighteenth century.  At the top, the sleeves and upper body of the robe are embellished with auspicious characters richly embroidered in green or purple silk or in gold thread.  The three characters—year or age (sai), longevity or celebration (ju) and pleasure or joy (raku)—proffer congratulatory wishes that may be part of a poem such as this one from the Hōunshū, an 18th century collection:As I hear the approach of the year's last day,May it celebrate the joys of your reign in the world.",
