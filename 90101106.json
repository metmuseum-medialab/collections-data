There are two variations within the series. 50 cards in the set depict unnamed actresses on a traditional-sized tobacco card with an ad for Duke cigarettes on both recto and verso. 50 more cards in the set repeat the same imagery of the same actresses but are die-cut and display the ad for Duke only on the verso. The total set of 100 cards is unnumbered.",
