  "The Cassady girls may have been cousins",
  "two girls with their names and of approximately the right ages have been found who might have been sent to Washington, D. C. to be schooled.  This sampler's maker may have been Catherine Cassady who was were born in Randolph, North Carolina on February 11, 1798, married Jonathan Lawrence in 1820, had three children, and died on September 25, 1828 in Bibb, Alabama.  The samplers were acquired at some point by W. Murray (1853-1920) and Josephine Boardman Crane (1873-1972), and descended to their daughter Louise Crane (1913-1997).  W. Murray Crane was a U. S. Senator and Governor of Massachusetts.  The samplers were sold at Skinner's auction house, Bolton, MA on June 12, 1994 (Lot 23) and were purchased by Susan and Mark Laracy, New Canaan, CT.  They were sold by the Laracys at Sotheby's NY on Jan 20, 2007 (Lot 148)."
