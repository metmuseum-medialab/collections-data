 "Description": "Although trained as an architect, Bellini is known less for his buildings than for his product design.  This tea and coffee service, a prototype for the silversmith Cleto Munari, reveals Bellini's strong architectural background.  All of the elements are reduced to minimal geometry: squares, circles, cylinders, a hemisphere.  Postmodernist designers often refer to a classical past through the use of historical detail.  Bellini however, suggests the discipline of classical architecture through form alone, without using any sort of conventional ornament.",
