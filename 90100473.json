 "Description": "Vertical panel with a textile design named \"Inca\", inspired by Native American patterns. The design consists of a pattern of blue and white cubes, all with an abstracted eye in their center. They are surrounded by symbols placed on the corners of a grid system, which resemble an abstract figure on two legs, alternately executed in yellow, white and blue or red. The red figures are orientated to the left and right whereas the multi-colored figures are presented upright. The design is part of a group of 266 textile designs by the American artist Robert Bryer. Most of the designs carry a stamp of the 'United Designing Co. / WOrth 4 - 8975'.",
