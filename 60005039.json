 "Description": "This dish from the ancient region of Gandhara dates from the second century B.C. to the first century A.D.  International trade with the Hellenistic world and India as well as invasions into Gandhara by the Scythians, Parthians, and Kushans brought many new stylistic idioms that shaped the stylistic vocabulary of these objects. Similar dishes were found in the Gandharan city of Sirkap (Taxila) in contexts that suggest they were used for domestic rituals, perhaps to ensure a positive afterlife.",
