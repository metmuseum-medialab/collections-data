 "Description": "The corrida, or bullfight, played a major role in Picasso's life and work.  He appreciated its rich cultural association with Spain and accorded the subject a key place in his personal iconography, particularly in his prints.  This image of a limp female bullfighter lying over the back of a disembowled horse is one of five that Picasso made in June 1934.  It would be reworked to become the central component of his greatest print, The Minotauromachy of 1935.",
