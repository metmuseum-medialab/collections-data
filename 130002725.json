 "Description": "This seated figure holding a roll of manuscript across his knees and a stylus in his right hand could represent a priest of high rank who transcribed oracles or other declarations of the god he served. The remains of a bird perched on his left hand and the elaborate throne with animals at the side suggest, however, that this statuette represents a deity—probably Apollo, the god of poetry and art, famous for his oracles. The bird may well have been a raven, the bird that often accompanies Apollo.",
