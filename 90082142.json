 "Description": "Candelabra grotesque, copied after a print made by Cornelis Metsys around 1545. The design is characterized by a strapwork structure in which various figures are placed. On the bottom, two river gods are depicted in the corners of the page. In the middle a female figure, possibly a Victory, is standing in a niche, flanked by terms. The terms support a panel with two birds and Bacchus in an oval compartment. On top of the panel, two sphinxes are depicted. The structure is crowned by an arch with a decorative mask. On ether side of the arch, a vase has been placed.",
