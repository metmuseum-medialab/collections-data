 "Description": "Chinese ceramics were highly valued and commonly imitated in Nishapur. The Nishapur imitations took different forms: the whiteness of the Chinese porcelains led local potters to develop the opaque white glazes with which they covered their wares, while the three-color sancai Chinese imports led to the invention of splashware, made by dripping brown, yellow, and green glazes over their pots. This medallion from the base of a bowl, with the molded image of a dragon with a flaming jewel, is an example of an imported Chinese sancai ware object; its find at Nishapur is an important piece of evidence in the story of Nishapuri pottery development.",
