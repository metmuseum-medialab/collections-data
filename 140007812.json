 "Description": "The unusual length of this silk fragment suggests that it may have been used as a furnishing fabric rather than for a garment. It bears a repeating ogival pattern in silver, blue, and gold on a red ground, with red, blue, and silver floral patterns within the ogival forms. The small red-and-white checkered motifs that fill the scrolling borders around the ogival medallions may be derived from Italian textiles, demonstrating the cultural and artistic relationship between Italy and the Ottoman Empire in the sixteenth century",
