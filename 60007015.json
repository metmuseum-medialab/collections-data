 "Description": "These fragments are from an elaborate halo that once adorned a larger-than-life-size Buddha or bodhisattva. The larger Buddha fragment holds his right hand in abhaya mudra, a gesture of approachability. The style of the robes attests to an interest in the classical forms of Gandhara.",
