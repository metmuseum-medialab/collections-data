 "Description": "While apprenticed to the renowned French potter Ernest Chaplet, Lenoble, who had worked in a faience factory, discovered stoneware. He went on to become one of the first modern ceramists to elevate it from a base material, suitable only for disposable utilitarian wares, to one worthy of the highest artistic expression. Lenoble’s marriage of delicate floral imagery with stoneware, a dense and raw material, is a testament to his creativity and skill; the ornament is infused witha naivete that was celebrated by contemporary artists who sought inspiration in primitive and vernacular traditions. The two large vases were bought by the New York collector Aline Meyer Liebman at the Exposition des Arts Décoratifs in Paris in 1925 and were later given to the Metropolitan. The Museum purchased the small vase in 1922 from Galerie Georges Rouard, Paris.",
