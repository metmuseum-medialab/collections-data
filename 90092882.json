 "Description": "Trade cards from the \"Fleischmann Bread\" series (D381), published in 1916 by Bradford & Co. of St. Joseph, Michigan, to promote Fleischmann Bakery of New York City and Ferguson Bakery of Boston. The full series of cards was printed in two complete sets, each promoting the individual baking companies. The Fleischmann cards were more widely distributed than those of Ferguson Bakery, and so the set has come to be known as the \"Fleischmann Bread\" series.",
