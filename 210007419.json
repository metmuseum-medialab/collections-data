 "Description": "Delaherche is principally known for a masterful series of robust andexperimental Japanese-inspired salt-glazed stoneware vessels made atthe end of the nineteenth century. Since the market for these pieces waslimited, he also made wares with a broader appeal such as this porcelainbowl from a series he made beginning in 1910. Its material and techniquespecifically reference an eighteenth-century Chinese export porcelain knownas blanc-de-Chine.",
