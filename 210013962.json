 "Description": "This edition of selected notes details the ideas and thought processes behind Duchamp's ground-breaking work The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (The Large Glass) (1915-23). The haphazard appearance of the box’s contents belies the care Duchamp took in its creation: he painstakingly tore collotype reproductions along the edges of custom-made templates in the shape of ninety-three notes originally written on stray scraps of paper. The results offer viewers the opportunity to become active participants in the notes’ arrangement and interpretation.",
