 "Description": "While conforming to the fashionable silhouette of the period, this hat, with its refined and striking application of pleated silk dress fabric, gives an almost fantastical effect. Far from being an aberrant offspring of some mad eccentric, the beautiful execution indicates a seasoned and sophisticated hand in its creation.  The abstract coral-like print reflects a modern sensibility which was increasingly evident in textile designs of the early 20th century.",
