 "Description": "In 1907 White and Stieglitz collaborated on a series of nude studies in which they planned to experiment with various lenses and papers.  Stieglitz placed the camera and choreographed the poses, much as he would later do in his extensive portrait of Georgia O'Keeffe, while White focused the camera and developed the negatives.  These three photographs illustrate the range of the imagery and its progression from the most formal and demure image in which the draped Miss Thompson assumes a cool classical pose to the second image which is surprisingly intimate and unaffected.  Combining the compositional strength and naturalism of the first two photographs, but exchanging props and interior surroundings for tight framing and expressive chiaroscuro, the third and most accomplished photograph is both modern and sensual. (exhibited with 33.43.385 and 33.43.386)",
