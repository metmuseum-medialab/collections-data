 "Description": "Birds represent a frequent motif on this class of jugs with so-called free-field decoration. The variety in the birds' articulation is noteworthy, although the recurrent basic species is characterized by a rather large body, a long neck with pronounced beak, and wiry talons. Here the figure appears in front of a lotus flower.",
