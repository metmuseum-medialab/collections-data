 "Description": "The visual presence of this dress is quite stunning.  The combination of the lime green georgette and metallic embroidery is simply eye-catching.  The 1920s created a new sense of style, introducing a new tubular silhouette and a shorter skirt.  This new look promoted a more modern, independent woman.  This dress is a wonderful representation of that new freedom, as seen through the detailed design.",
