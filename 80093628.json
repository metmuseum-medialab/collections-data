 "Description": "The level of embroidery detail on this handkerchief is extraordinary. The workmanship is of a type commonly done by convent nuns. Each scene has a common theme of love and romance from mythology, including Narcissus gazing at his reflection in the water, and Cupid holding his arrow. The imagery is particularly charming for a man's accessory and reflects on the aristocratic status of the owner.",
